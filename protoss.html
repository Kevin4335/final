    <h1>What are the Protoss?</h1>
    <p class = "summary">
        The Protoss faction in StarCraft 2 utilizes advanced technology and resilient units. Their Warpgate technology enables instantaneous unit deployment, facilitating swift reinforcement and strategic maneuvering. Protoss units feature energy-based shields that regenerate when not taking damage, necessitating careful engagement handling. Pylon placement is crucial as they power structures within their field. The tech tree branches into Gateway, Robotics Facility, and Stargate units, offering strategic versatility. Their arsenal includes units like the Immortal, known for its durability against heavy damage, alongside units with specialized abilities like Psi Storm and Force Fields for battlefield control. Mastery of these abilities, along with adept unit compositions and strategic positioning, defines successful Protoss gameplay.
