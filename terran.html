    <h1>What are the Terrans?</h1>
    <p class = "summary">
        The Terran faction in StarCraft 2 embodies a versatile, adaptable playstyle centered on advanced technology and tactical warfare. They rely on production structures: the Barracks, Factories, and Starports, allowing diverse unit production and specialization. Terran units are self-sufficient and highly modular, featuring abilities like stimpacks for increased combat prowess or Siege Tanks for long-range siege capabilities. Their structures can be lifted off and relocated, offering strategic mobility on the battlefield. The tech tree branches through upgrades at the Engineering Bay, Armory, and Fusion Core, allowing for diverse strategic choices. The terran thrive on strategic positioning, efficient resource management, and adaptability to counter various threats and situations during engagements.    </p>
