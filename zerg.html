    <h1>What are the Zerg?</h1>
    <p class = "summary">
        The Zerg in StarCraft 2 epitomize a swarm-based, adaptable playstyle centered around rapid expansion and overwhelming numbers. They rely on Larva mechanics, generating units from Hatcheries, Lairs, and Hives, enabling exponential unit production. Zerg units are individually weaker but compensate with efficiency in numbers and adaptability through morphing. Their structures spread creep, providing movement speed bonuses and vision. The tech tree branches through Evolution Chambers, Infestation Pits, and Spawning Pools, allowing for diverse unit evolution. Zerg possess units like Zerglings for swarm attacks, Banelings for explosive damage, and powerful spellcasters such as Infestors. The race demands rapid expansion, resource management, and aggressive play to overpower opponents with sheer numbers and swarm tactics.    </p>
